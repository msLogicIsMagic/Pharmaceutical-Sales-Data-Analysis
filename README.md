# Pharmaceutical-Sales-Data-Analysis
In this project, we will be using Power BI to analyze pharmaceutical sales data. The dataset used for this project has been sourced from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/milanzdravkovic/pharma-sales-data

From the given link, it has already been stated that the data has already been pre-processed, which included outlier detection and treatment and missing data imputation. However, I have also performed due diligence and ensured that all the data we have are of the right format. I have also added a calendar table and marked it as the date table.
